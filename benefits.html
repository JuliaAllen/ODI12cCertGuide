    </head>
    
    <h3>Oracle Data Integrator (ODI) 12<em>c</em> Overview</h3>
    <ul>
<li>Describe the benefits of ODI and its typical use cases</li></ul>
        
Oracle Data Integrator is focused on fast bulk data movement and handling complex transformations in an E-LT architecture. It has extended support for Big Data and is built to perform transformations on-premise or in the cloud.
        
ODI is fully integrated with GG, Oracle database, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle Big Data Appliance, Oracle Enterprise Data Quality and works with 3rd party applications as well.
        
It will reduce development costs, improve productivity and lower total cost of ownership. It also reduces network traffic/loads by transforming data in the target source (on the server containing the target data). It is flexible and has lightweight deployment.
        
<h3><u><b>ODI: No new servers</b></u></h3>
<ul>
		<li>Lower cost: leverage compute resources & partition workload efficiently</li>
		<li>Efficient: exploits DB optimizer</li>
		<li>Fast: exploits native bulk load & other db interfaces</li>
		<li>Scalable: scales as you add processors to source or target</li>
		<li>Manageability: unified Enterprise Manager</li>
            
</ul>

<h3><u><b>Declarative Design</b></u></h3>
<ul>
        <li>Easy/Universal for designing simple to complex mappings</li>
		<li>Reusable Mappings: for any physical design</li>
		<li>Quick: high degree of automation</li>
</ul>
    
    This "allows you to create an abstraction layer between the developer and the actual code that is going to be performed by the DBMS. This means that in ODI you define “what you want to get”
    
<h3><u><b>Benefits</b></u></h3>        
<ul>
		<li>Leverages set-based transformation</li>
		<li>Improves performance for loading (no network hop)</li>
		<li>Takes advantage of existing infrastructure: hardware and software</li>
		<li>Significantly reduces learning curve</li>
		<li>Shortens implementation times</li>
		<li>Simpler maintenance</li>
</ul>
        
<h3><u><b>Big Data</b></u></h3>
        
        It also offers support for most common Hadoop standards.  In addition, it fully supports Spark Streaming (no need to write any code), Apache Kafka (sources/targets), and Cassandra (sources/targets). It already supported Hive, Pig and batch Spark. 
        
        Versioning (Lifecycle Management):
        
        ODI 12c offers Git as an external version control system and further extends Apache Subversion capabilities.
