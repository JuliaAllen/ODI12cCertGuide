<h3>Oracle Data Integrator (ODI) 12<em>c</em></h3> 
    <ul><li>Create ODI Datastores</li></ul>
        
ODI uses the term datastore very broadly so all database tables are datastores, but a datastore is not necessarily a database table. For right now, we will be referring to the tables.
        <br></br>
Per Oracle, a model is the description of a set of datastores and is based on the logical schemas defined in the topology where it is mapped to the physical schema. Models in ODI only contain metadata (aka it is - at this point - ONLY the description of the data structures, there is no data in it yet). 
        <br></br>
Datastores represent the data structure (table, flat file, etc - anything accessible to ODI). When you create a new model there is no data in it, that occurs when you reverse-engineer the table.
