Mappings: logical and physical organization of your data sources, targets and the transformations through which the data flows from source to target. 
    
Mapping Compoents are divided into 2 categories:
    
    Projector Components: influence the attributes present in the data that flows through a mapping. It hides all attributes originating from preceding components; all succeeding components can only use attributes from the projector (ex: reusable mappings, aggregates, distincts, creating sets, dataset in a mapping)
    
    Selector Components: re-use attributes from preceding components. (ex: join, lookups, filters, sorts, splits). They are represented as a round shape. 
    
Components:
    
    Datastores (DS): act as Projector Components. Source DS are read by the mapping. Target DS are elements that are loaded by the mapping.
    
    Datasets: option to use as a source in a mapping. Provide logical container where you organize sources, define joins and filters through entity-relationship mechanism (vs flow mechanism used elsewere). Datasets act as selector components.
    
    Reusable Mappings: can be nested. Can include datastores as sources and targets itself. Act as projector components. 
    
    Component Palette: You can also use the following in the mapping diagram: Expression, Aggregate, Distinct, Set, Filter, Join, Lookup, Sort, Split
    
    Connections: create flow of data between mapping components. Most have input and output connectors. If it only has an input, it is a source. If it only has output connector, it is a target. 
    
    Staging Schemas: specify a staging area for a mapping or for a specific deployment specification of a mapping. To define a different staging area than any of the source or target datastores, you must define the correct physical and logical schemas in the mapping's execution context before creating a mapping (Topology)
    
    Knowledge Modules: how data is moved from source to target in ODI. 
    
    Variables, Sequences and User Functions: used in mappings as expressions. Created in the project. 
    
    
    Expressions have a result type, such as VARCHAR or NUMERIC. Conditions are boolean, meaning, the result of a condition should always evaluate to TRUE or FALSE. A condition is needed for filter, join, and lookup (selector) components, while an expression is used in datastore, aggregate, and distinct (projector) components, to perform some transformation or create the attribute-level mappings.
